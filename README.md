# React Food Order App with HTTP

Added checkout with validation and HTTP on the react food order app. Users can now order food, checkout and theur data will be sent to the Firebase Realtime Database backend when succesfully submitted.

Still pretty basic but now more functional using real APIs to submit data to a back-end.
